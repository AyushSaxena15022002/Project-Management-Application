A Project Management Application which include CRUD Operations along with User-Friendly Interfaces for the Project Management . Project(s) include characteristics like Description , DUE DATE and various tasks which can be assigned , modified or removed inside the Project.

Through this project I gained hands-on experience and was able to reinforce my understanding of state management in React by using features like useState , useEffect , useReducer , useRef , forwardRef, etc. Modularity is achieved by dividing large Components into various reusable components which are rendered as per their functionality and their functionalities are passed using prop drilling . I learned how to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically update content based on user actions.

I have used Tailwind CSS thus making the development process more efficient , and maintaining a consistent and responsive user interface. As it follows a utility-first approach, providing a set of utility classes that I have applied directly in the HTML and React components. The Project improved my CSS skills for styling and layout, creating an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly interface.

I have used Local Storage as a means to persistently store data on the client's device. This is done to reduce server load and thereby improving website's performance whilst providing a personalized experience for users who return to the website.
